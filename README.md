I'm learning Rust.  So can you be too.
======================================

I'm learning Rust 0.11 from the curriculum at
https://andrewlorente.com/learning_rust

- [x] I have read sections 1-10 (see hello.rs, enum-struct-tuple.rs, list*.rs, and
syntax10.rs).

- [x] I have written three FizzBuzz implementations &mdash; a flexible one, one based on an iterator, and a simple one.

- [x] I have rad sections 11-19.
